## Kalshi Trades

Each row represents a single trade execution.

| Column | Type | Description |

| `created_time` | datetime | When the trade occurred |
| `_fetched_at` | datetime | When this record was fetched |

**Note on Kalshi prices:** Prices are in cents. A `yes_price` of 65 means the contract costs $0.65 and pays $1.00 if the outcome is "Yes" (implied probability: 65%). The `no_price` is always `100 - yes_price`.

## Polymarket Legacy Trades (FPMM)

Each row represents an `FPMMBuy` or `FPMMSell` event from the legacy Fixed Product Market Maker contracts on Polygon. These are trades from before Polymarket migrated to the CTF Exchange (roughly 2020-2022).

**Note on legacy trade amounts:** The `amount`, `fee_amount`, and `outcome_tokens` fields are stored as strings to avoid integer overflow. Collateral amounts use 6 decimals (for USDC markets), while outcome tokens use 18 decimals.

## Polymarket FPMM Collateral Lookup

Located at `data/polymarket/fpmm_collateral_lookup.json`, this file maps FPMM contract addresses to their collateral token information. Used to filter legacy trades to only include USDC-collateralized markets.

```json
{
  "0x1234...": {
    "collateral_address": "0x2791Bca1f2de4661ED88A30C99A7a9449Aa84174",
    "collateral_symbol": "USDC"
  }
}
```
